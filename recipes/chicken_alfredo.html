    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Boneless skinless Chicken thighs</li>
            <li>Granulated Garlic</li>
            <li>Paprika</li>

            <li>White wine</li>
            <li>boxed pasta</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl combine even parts Granulated garlic,Parpika,salt,and pepper, thoroughly mix and then coat chicken</li>
            <li>In a seperate pot prepare some water to boil your choice of boxed pasta (I also add a splash of salt and olive oil to my pasta water) </li>
            <li>While you wait for the water to come to a boil you can start to sear you chicken, this method usually requires med-high heat(note:completely cook chicken
                 to internal temp of 165 degrees </li>
            <li>When you are done searing your chicken add finely chopped garlic and shallots there should be burnt bits on the bottom of the pan prior to adding these ingredients</li>
            <li>By this time you pasta water should be boiling and you can add in your boxed pasta</li>
            <li>When the garlic and shallots are browned add your selection of white wine to the saucepan you want to continue to have a high heat to burn off any alcohol in the wine</li>
            <li>when the alcohol is burned off you can add heavy cream, salt and parpika to taste and continue stirring to avoid boil-overs</li>
            <li>Bring temperature back down to a simmer</li>
            <li>assuming your pasta is cooked we want to put a cup of the pasta water to the side and get rid of the excess water</li>
            <l1>after seperating the pata from the water we will add back the one cup of water and our cooked pasta into the saucepan containing our heavy cream concotion</l1>
            <li>Continue folding pasta into sauce as your remove pan from heat</li>
            <li>at this point all there is left is to plate</li> 
            <li>Take your favorite pasta bowl, grab a scoop of your finished pasta w/white sauce, then place your chicken over the pasta like a michelin starred chef</li>
